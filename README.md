## Hi there! I'm Phuc — but you can call me "the guy who makes robots dance (sometimes not)."

- Experienced embedded engineer learning the dark arts of kernel drivers and wireless sorcery.
- Currently battling with Embedded Linux on some "old" SBCs.
- Writing drivers from scratch, just because "it builds character."
- Obsessed with making things *modular*, *clean*, and *sometimes overly complicated*.
- Surviving on coffee, debugging logs, and pure hope.

### Tech playgrounds:
- Kernel driver stuff (`insmod && pray`)
- Embedded C / C++ (occasionally readable)
- Yocto builds (sometimes by accident)
- UART / I2C / SPI wizardry
- Working on a reinforcement-learning-controlled hexapod

### Fun Fact:
> *I once spent 3 hours fixing a typo in a Makefile and called it "learning."*

### Life motto:
> "If it doesn’t work... write a kernel module. If it still doesn’t work… blame the hardware."
