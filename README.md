## 👋 Hi there! I'm Phúc — but you can call me "the guy who makes robots dance (sometimes not)." 🤖✨

- 🎓 Final-year embedded student learning the dark arts of kernel drivers and wireless sorcery.
- 🐧 Currently battling with Embedded Linux on some old SBCs.
- 🚀 Writing drivers from scratch, just because "it builds character."
- 🧩 Obsessed with making things *modular*, *clean*, and *sometimes overly complicated*.
- 🍵 Surviving on coffee, debugging logs, and pure hope.

### 💻 Tech playgrounds:
- Kernel driver stuff (`insmod && pray`)
- Embedded C / C++ (occasionally readable)
- Yocto builds (sometimes by accident)
- BLE / WiFi / GNSS wizardry
- Working on a reinforcement-learning-controlled hexapod 🐜🤖

### 🎯 Fun Fact:
> *I once spent 3 hours fixing a typo in a Makefile and called it "learning."*

### 😎 Life motto:
> "If it doesn’t work... write a kernel module. If it still doesn’t work… blame the hardware."
